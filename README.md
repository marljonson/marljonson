### 🪼 About Me

Hi there! My name is Marl. I'm a computer programmer interested in making and managing software products in entertainment, music, and popular culture. I'm pursuing a minor in statistics to better understand the communities behind online platforms — from creators looking to license music for their games, to developers optimizing user engagement, to players and users whose behavior can inform smarter recommendation systems and tailored experiences.
